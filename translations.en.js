                <div class="text-base leading-relaxed space-y-4">
                    <p>Ruy Guerra is a well- known name to cinema fans. In the 1960s, the period of the Cinema Novo, renewing Brazilian cinema, Ruy, born in Mozambique, arrived in Rio de Janeiro, direct from Paris, where he had graduated in Film Making. Today he is one of the surviving myths of the Cinema Novo, indeed one the most famous, having been the first of the group to shoot films outside Brazil. He is also known to those who enjoy Brazilian popular music from the 1960s and 70s, when he partnered young musicians. In 1958 Ruy came to Rio de Janeiro, which has been his safe haven until today. The trip to Brazil was a desire expressed years earlier in letters to his father, brother and friends.</p>
                    <p>At the moment (August 2014) he is a well-lived 83 years-old, whose energy makes those of us who are much younger envy him. Many say that this energy comes from his home country, Mozambique, on the edge of the Indian Ocean in southern Africa. He is the son of a Portuguese couple who were trying life in the Portuguese colony and who settled in the capital, Lourenço Marques, and started a family. Since he was ten Ruy has been crazy about writing, film and film making, and during the second half of the 1940s he published short stories, articles and poetry in newspapers and even today repeatedly talks about his frustrated vocation as a writer, reaffirming his desire to write a novel. The complicated situation of living financially from film making also led him to direct the concerts of his friends, and he also wrote the play ‘Calabar: in praise of treason’ in partnership with Chico Buarque. It was banned on the eve of the premiere, causing financial losses to the producers. Like many contemporaries, Chico Buarque and Ruy Guerra often had problems with the lyrics.</p>
                    <p>Since his teens Ruy has understood filmmaking as a way of thinking and presenting political and social relations. Lourenço Marques was the most important port on the Indian Ocean in Southern Africa, and much of the south of the continent's trade passed through the port. At 16, with an 8 mm. camera borrowed from a friend, he filmed the reality of the Cais Gorjão harbour, portraying the lives of black workers. He filmed them resting under wagons, eating, sleeping under trains; for Ruy for these images ‘reminded me of concentration camps’. According to one analyst, Ruy as an amateur film maker, ‘flirted with social critique’.</p>

                    <p>In the family home and the Liceu Salazar state secondary school, Ruy received a Portuguese education. He and his classmates were educated by teachers ‘banished from Portugal by the Dictatorship’, ‘critical thinkers’ who made them read a lot, resulting in many students becoming rebels against the status quo. They refused to accept the cultural production of the Salazar dictatorship, and Brazilian cultural material was very important, not only because Brazil was a former Portuguese colony that had become independent, but also because of the similarities between the cultures of Mozambique and Brazil (the climate, the presence of black people, the aromas and flavours...). Brazilian literature and magazines, which were were often censored and had to enter the country illegally, impressed this generation, called the Mozambique ‘diaspora’. Ruy stated in an interview: ‘Some of us made up a generation that mostly left the country and distinguished itself in the arts, philosophy (...) because of the political and social context in which they were born and raised (...) it was not by chance or just as a result of individual psychological conditions’. This generation used culture as their form of political revolt against colonialism and racism. Ruy, concerned with the relations of domination and subordination in the colony, was interrogated and arrested by the police of the Portuguese dictatorship because of his independent thinking at the Liceu, and because of his activities and those of his group he was eventually legally prevented from visiting Portugal for a number of years.</p>
                    <p>At 20 he went to study film in Paris and arrived in the French capital at a very important moment for cinema as young filmmakers were trying to impose their auteur style on the traditional large-scale industry. He professionally graduated during this period, the early 1950s, when the traditional cinema was being renewed, with the first ripples of the Nouvelle Vague. He recalls the movement as being made up of young French intellectuals to whom he, as a foreign immigrant, felt very different: ‘[The Nouvelle Vague] always had a clear right-wing position and I […] was definitely on the left [...] I condemned French intellectuals for their lack of political engagement, they never talked about the war in Algeria or about immigrants’. He attended the Institut des Hautes Études Cinématographiques (IDHEC) and was seen by classmates as an excellent student, better educated than others, though a permanent questioner. He also studied acting for two years on a course at the Théâtre National de Paris (NPT).</p>
                    <p>In Paris he got to know Brazilians, with whom he came to try his chance in the New World which he hoped to conquer through his enthusiasm for film. He carried in his luggage the first script he wrote shortly after graduating and which he had been attempting in many ways to film in the Old World. This script would later become ‘Os Fuzis’ [The Guns], which won the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival in 1964 and was one of the most remarkable films of that period.</p>
                    <div class="my-6 text-center"><img class="mx-auto max-w-2xl w-full rounded shadow-lg" src="https://placehold.co/800x500/d8cbb7/5a4a3b?text=Cinema+Novo+Group" alt="Cinema Novo in Brazil"><p class="text-sm italic mt-2">Meeting of filmmakers for a the French TV programme, ‘Carnets brésiliens’, Copacabana 1966</p></div>
                    <p>Ruy jokes that he was born as a filmmaker with the Cinema Novo but he was not born into it, among the young people between whom, despite the usual rivalries and clashes, there was a close cooperation on the basis of the films they made. It was a cinema search of identity: ‘We were interested in producing films that portrayed the reality of the people, political and social conflicts, to escape the production rules and dogmas of the aesthetics of the industrial cinema’. However, Ruy did not practice the art as weapon of revolutionary propaganda; his filmography can hardly be seen as didactic but was rather part of a generation which, in the 1960s, wished to change the world to what they believed was the best for society; and also, for some of them, including Ruy, their daily lives.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, Ruy has worked in various functions related to the screen (photographer, assistant director, director, screenwriter, actor, editor, executive producer, executive and artistic director and teacher), in writing poetry, lyrics, and newspaper columns, shows and plays (which he sometimes also directed). He recently declared himself ‘a typical artist produced by underdevelopment’, who has had to work in various forms of art in order to survive. He has used all his gifts with words; in addition to writing poems, lyrics, he wrote and directed plays, and for five years penned a weekly column in the Cadernos Dois supplement of the O Estado de São Paulo newspaper.</p>
                    <p>Economic difficulties, an inherent part of the Brazilian authorial cinema, led him for a time to live from writing lyrics in the Zona Sul in Rio de Janeiro for musician friends such as Sergio Ricardo, Edu Lobo, Chico Buarque de Holanda, Francis Hime, Carlos Lyra, Luiz Eça and Milton Nascimento. A talented writer of lyrics, he has written more than a hundred songs, which abandoned the contents of the ‘the little boat and the flower’ of the Bossa Nova for a stronger social theme and content. The difficulty of living from his films also led to work with the theatre, directing the concerts of his friends and, when invited, he also directed a number of plays. He also wrote in partnership with Chico Buarque ‘Calabar: in praise of treason’, which was banned by the censorship of the military dictatorship. Like many others, Chico Buarque and Ruy often had various problems with the lyrics.</p>
                    <p>Ruy is very proud of being classified as a political filmmaker. Since his adolescence he has been a politician a broad sense: being involved with the problems of his time. He repeatedly says: ‘I look at reality from a political and cultural point of view.’ Throughout his life Ruy has taken this political position with a capital P, though never having been an activist or member of a political party. Ruy sees himself and is seen as a man of the left from the way he speaks and lives, and his art and teaching. He believes all aesthetics are political, as they will always contain a worldview and will be anchored to a set of values they present, defend or condemn. In 1997, the film critic Maria do Rosario Caetano noted that he retained the ‘highly political rhetoric of the 1960s’ and did not believe in the end of ideology; and in recent speeches and writings Ruy seems to confirm this.</p>
                    <p>From 1960 to 1970 Ruy worked in France on a number of occasions in film and television. He was close to the group linked to film magazine Positif. In 1965 the French magazine Cahiers de Cinema, which gave great prominence to the Brazilian Cinema Novo, summarized the themes of his films: cruelty, violence, racism, never-ending time... According to Ruy, ‘Whoever analyses my films has said that there is a kind of obsession for the areas of power and repressive mechanisms, whether in the family environment, social structures or government.’</p>
                    <p>The socialist revolution of the new People's Republic of Mozambique, victorious in 1975 under the leadership of Samora Machel, initially gave a fundamental role to film in the construction of national identity. It was an important part of the attempt to unite many tribes, whose culture is based on oral tradition, into a nation. Urged by former friends, who now had posts in the government, Ruy started to actively collaborate in the creation of the National Film Institute of Mozambique (INC) and the training of film technicians; he gave practical lessons and brought to Maputo (formerly Lourenço Marques) many experts in various aspects of film. He intensely lived the experience of independence and decolonization of the country where he was born; his African films are by their nature political.</p>
                    <p>His left-wing position is also clear in his relations with Cuba, where he lived for various periods. Since the beginning of the International Festival of New Latin American Cinema in 1979, his films have been shown there. Since 1988 he has been part of the teaching staff of the well-known Escuela Internacional de Cine y TV in San Antonio de Los Baños, 30 kilometres from Havana. He took part in projects and scripts with Gabriel García Márquez, ‘Gabo’, a founder of the school, who became his personal friend. He was the most important maker of Gabo’s films: ‘Erêndira’, ‘Fábula de la bella Palomera’, ‘Veneno de la Madrugada’ and ‘Me alquilo para soñar’ (a mini-series for Spanish television, filmed entirely in Havana). At the end of the 1990s he also made in Havana ‘Estorvo’, adapted from the novel by Chico Buarque, with the main part played by the Cuban actor Jorge Perrugoria and a team largely made up of Cuban technicians.</p>
                    <div class="my-6 text-center"><img class="mx-auto max-w-2xl w-full rounded shadow-lg" src="https://placehold.co/800x500/d8cbb7/5a4a3b?text=Ruy+and+Gabo" alt="Ruy Guerra and Gabriel Garca Mrquez"><p class="text-sm italic mt-2">Ruy Guerra and Gabriel García Márquez during the filming of ‘Erêndira’, Mexico, 1982</p></div>
                    <p>Brazilian and Latin American filmmakers sometimes remain decades without being able to film because they face permanent economic problems and sometimes difficulties due to the political situation. Ruy managed to shoot long, medium and short length films in Brazil, France, Portugal, Spain, Mexico, and Cuba. He has often said: ‘I didn’t make all the films I wanted to, but I wanted to make all the films that I did make.’ At the beginning of the 21st century he was invited to write for the theatre on Don Quixote, creating a musical called ‘Don Quixote from Nowhere’, an adaptation of Don Quixote to the Northeast of Brazil.</p>
                    <p>And when he was unable to film he was involved in teaching, organizing film courses in Rio de Janeiro from the 1990s. His teaching activities in the last 10-12 years have developed into courses, lectures and workshops. In an interview he said: ‘I say in the first lesson: If you have come here to make a North American film it is easy. Let’s go to the bar, and in an hour, I’ll tell you all you need to know. […] I tell them that it's not worth wasting two and a half years to make films like the Americans. Now, if the guy wants to make Brazilian films, he will spend two years in college making an effort, and he will continue making an effort, and will not leave college knowing how to make Brazilian films. It's another thing: it’s a quest, it is to make a link with reality; it is to know who you are’. He emphasizes how fundamental it is to ‘open the heads of young people to the act of thinking about art, cultural education [...] so that a person can take on such a great responsibility [...] for this means of expression that is in my view so vital and important, so politically and aesthetically important.’</p>
                    <p>When talking about movies and the market his position is clear: ‘The equations of society are all poorly made, and you live with these wrong equations. A film does not have to have 10 million viewers. A movie has to be seen by X people who can take from this film something important for their lives. It's different. Because of these millions of viewers there are usually not even ten that take from the film something important for their lives. They have consumed the film as a product, as 'fast food'. [...] It is important to see that seeing these American films is the same as eating at Macdonald's. There's no difference. [...] You must be careful, very careful.’</p>
                    <p>The study and practice of a cinematic language is constantly renewed in his filmmaking, and Ruy stresses how important this is: ‘Something fundamental for me is to find structures that break with standard concepts, basically the North American hegemonic structure, which I believe reduces reality and is of no use for our culture. [...]. This refusal, this factor of refusal, I believe, is still present today. Many films are wrong, but I think this is even present in these films that are wrong’.</p>
                    <p>He has lived in various countries and different continents and has been called ‘a citizen of the world’. His path through life cannot be separated from his artistic production, as his artistic quest has been the defining factor of his movements through space and time. He defines himself: ‘Half African, half Portuguese, half Brazilian, somewhat Latin, half lost, 100% of what in this cocktail of anguishes?’</p>
